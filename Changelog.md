# CurvePane_v0.1.5

## Release Note

I've finished the Lagarange Polynomial Interpolation.

## Changelog

* Implemented the Lagarange Polynomial Interpolation.
* Extracted some classes to individual libraries.

****
# CurvePane_v0.0.1

## Release Note

No public API is available yet. But I have finished most part of the curve processing procedure, so I decided to publish it as v0.0.1 to mark the first step of this project.

## Changelog

* Implemented the data processing procedure of Lagrange Linear Interpolation;
* Implemented most of the interfaces used in curve data structures;
* Implemented the layout of the GUI;

****
# CurvePane_Readme

The final project for my Product Modeling Tech class

## Introduction

https://github.com/buaaqlyj/CurvePane

This program can draw some curve splines which are commonly used in Product Modeling, including: Polynomial curves, CSI curve(Cubic Spline Interpolation), Parametric Cubic Spline curve, Bézier curve, B-Spline curve and NURBS curve.
